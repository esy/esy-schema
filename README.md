# esy-schema

![Test](https://github.com/esy/esy-schema/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

A simple json schema that extends the json schema for package.json and adds fields relative to esy.

## Usage

To use it in a vscode extension, look at how this is done for [vscode-merlin](https://github.com/arrowresearch/vscode-merlin/blob/eb7583bca88c8da9c466173c83f949624b2a774c/package.json#L21).

It is also possible to specify its use [manually in vscode](https://github.com/arrowresearch/vscode-merlin/blob/eb7583bca88c8da9c466173c83f949624b2a774c/package.json#L21) for example. Other editors also have their way of specifying json schema using the json language server.
